Limited attention and reductions in executive functioning due to the stressor were postulated as underlying mechanisms for dysfunctional strategy use. The decrease in adjustment under stress was also explained by limited cognitive resources (Kassam et al., 2009). However, this decrease only occurred when the stress was perceived as a threat while the perception of stress as a challenge led to an increased performance. Participants under threat stress do not overcome their first automatic response and fail to make a controlled rational adjustment. Stress may lead to an exaggerated reliance on lower level automatic response tendencies and to a decrease of controlled cognitive processes (Masicampo and Baumeister, 2008). This reliance on lower level systems should make participants particularly prone to framing effects when stressed."

In a more recent review of research of high school organisation and its effects on students and teachers, Bryk, Lee, and Smith (1990) reported that, \"the overall distribution of student characteristics shapes the curricular offerings of a school and the policies which map students into courses\" (p. 147).
